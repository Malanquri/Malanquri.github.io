### Introduction
Crime is a normal part of societies. Many recourses are assigned to monitor, address, and prevent crimes. Crime could have huge cost on individuals. Thier costs could affect individuals phiscally and mentily. I believe analazing crime data could give insghts about the crime trinds. 
### Why Boston 
Bostin is one of the oldest cities on the united stat. it is ranked as the 21st on population size. Boston Police Department have released their crime report data set to aid researchers in anlazing crimes.

It is clear that 2017 has the highest number of crimes. However, 2016 is not too far behind. What is most interesting is that the number of crimes dropped significantly in 2015 and 2018 compared to 2016 and 2017.  I believe that part of the future work could include investigating why the crime dropped in those years.

#### Second Question
The second question can be answered by the plot below

What is really interesting is that Motor Vehicle Accident Assisstance is the top crime in every year. This is an alerting result which indicates the need of awareness campigans to increase the awareness and reduce the number of motor vehicle crimes.
